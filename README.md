#Directionality paper for IJOC#

## Abstract

Directional preferences in moving images are primarily theorized as deriving from cultural factors, principally the dominant language's reading/writing direction. This study examines the origins of this notion and positions it within recent analytical thinking. In order to expand the context of analysis it draws in research from neurology and knowledge of typical production tools.

Two manifestations of directionality – camera panning (pans) and soundbite gaze direction – are compared, data coming from two countries, Japan and the UK, where directional conventions differ.

Reading/writing direction seems to be linked to directional preferences in television news image creation, but the process involved may be subconscious rather than conscious, analysts must thus be wary of ‘over-reading’ manifestations of directionality in news images.

### About this repository

This is part of an attempt to move my writing workflow in a more efficient direction. This involves moving the initial writing process to a plain text environment and using pandoc (and a variety of other tools) to create the various necessary file formats as simply as possible. I also want to get used to using Git/hub.
